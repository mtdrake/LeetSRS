# Leetreps

Leetreps is a Chrome extension for practicing Leetcode problems via spaced repetition. The project was bootstrapped with the [WXT extension framework](https://wxt.dev/). The extension supports the following use-cases:

1. Add problems to the user's SRS collection
2. Remove problems from the user's SRS collection
3. Review due cards by assigning one of the four SRS ratings: again, hard, good, easy
4. Show a daily review streak
