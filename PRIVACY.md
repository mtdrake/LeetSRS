# LeetSRS Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: August 6, 2025**

LeetSRS is a Chrome extension that helps you with spaced repetition for
LeetCode problems. Your privacy is important. This policy explains what
information the extension handles and where it is stored.

## Data We Handle

LeetSRS **does not** collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on
our servers. All data generated by the extension is stored in one of two
places:

1.  **On Your Local Machine (`chrome.storage.local`):**
    - Your saved LeetCode problems (cards), including review history and notes.
    - Your daily review statistics.

2.  **In Your Personal Cloud Storage (`chrome.storage.sync`):**
    - Your extension settings, such as theme and daily limits.

This data is managed by your browser and is not accessible to us.

## Data Usage and Sharing

Since we do not collect your data, we do not use or share it with any third
parties.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this
page.
